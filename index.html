	<h3>Caddy Cicogna</h3>
	<p>I am a 19 year old female artist currently residencing in Beverly, MA for my second year as a student at Montserrat College of art. I plan to major in Art Education with a fine arts focus in Printmaking. I believe its important to take advantage of muliple courses and mediums offered to get a well rounded education. I have taken courses in anything from multiple forms of traditional printmaking which has helped me to view and practice process, web authoring which has promoted me to become more educated in not only coding but using illustrator as well, life drawing which has helped me to better observe things and translate them with accuracy, photography, and art ed courses.</p>
	<p>I was born into this world on May 12th 1998, and was raised in Roaming Shores, Ohio along side my younger brother, Frankie. At the age of three I was diagnosed with Type One Diabetes, which was hard on my family and myself as I was growing up, but I now have full control in take good care and maintaining it. My mother is a third grade teacher in a local public elementary school and my father is owner and salesman at Cicogna Electric and Sign Company based is Ashtabula, Ohio.</p> 
	<p>I try to keep myself busy as much as I possibly can, during the school year I am a library assistant in the Montserrat Paul Scott Library, give campus tours, and help work Montserrats events. During the Summer I help creating and designing signage and prints for the salesmen to show to their customers and help out anywhere I can learning skills in the shop. I consider myself rather bubbly and always ready for a challenge, currently a hard working college student, and soon to be future educator of fine arts!</p>
