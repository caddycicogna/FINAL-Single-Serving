	<h3>Caddy Cicogna</h3>
	<p>I am a 19 year old female artist currently residencing in Beverly, MA for my second year as a student at Montserrat College of art. I plan to major in Art Education with a fine arts focus in Printmaking. I was born into this world on May 12th 1998, and was raised in Roaming Shores, Ohio along side my younger brother Frankie. My mother is a third grade teacher in a local public elementary school and her father is owner and salesman at Cicogna Electric and Sign Company based is Ashtabula, Ohio. I try to work as much as I possibly can, during the school year I am a library assistant in the Montserrat Paul Scott Library, give campus tours, and help work Montserrats events. During the Summer I help creating and designing signage and prints for the salesmen to show to their customers and help out anywhere I can learning skills in the shop. I consider myself rather bubbly and always ready for a challenge, currently a hard working college student, and soon to be future educator of fine arts!  </p>
